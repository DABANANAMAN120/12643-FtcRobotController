/*
 * This OpMode shows how to use the new universal IMU interface. This
 * interface may be used with the BNO055 IMU or the BHI260 IMU. It assumes that an IMU is configured
 * on the robot with the name "imu".
 *
 * The sample will display the current Yaw, Pitch and Roll of the robot.<br>
 * With the correct orientation parameters selected, pitch/roll/yaw should act as follows:
 *   Pitch value should INCREASE as the robot is tipped UP at the front. (Rotation about X) <br>
 *   Roll value should INCREASE as the robot is tipped UP at the left side. (Rotation about Y) <br>
 *   Yaw value should INCREASE as the robot is rotated Counter Clockwise. (Rotation about Z) <br>
 *
 * The yaw can be reset (to zero) by pressing the Y button on the gamepad (Triangle on a PS4 controller)
 *
 * This specific sample assumes that the Hub is mounted on one of the three orthogonal planes
 * (X/Y, X/Z or Y/Z) and that the Hub has only been rotated in a range of 90 degree increments.
 *
 * Note: if your Hub is mounted on a surface angled at some non-90 Degree multiple (like 30) look at
 *       the alternative SensorIMUNonOrthogonal sample in this folder.
 *
 * This "Orthogonal" requirement means that:
 *
 * 1) The Logo printed on the top of the Hub can ONLY be pointing in one of six directions:
 *    FORWARD, BACKWARD, UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT.
 *
 * 2) The USB ports can only be pointing in one of the same six directions:<br>
 *    FORWARD, BACKWARD, UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT.
 *
 * So, To fully define how your Hub is mounted to the robot, you must simply specify:<br>
 *    logoFacingDirection<br>
 *    usbFacingDirection
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list.
 *
 * Finally, choose the two correct parameters to define how your Hub is mounted and edit this OpMode
 * to use those parameters.
